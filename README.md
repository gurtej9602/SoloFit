# SoloFit
**SoloFit** is a web-based application designed to make fitness fun by integrating gamified elements. Inspired by the **Solo Leveling** system, this tracker assigns personalized workout programs to users and helps them track their progress in strength, stamina, endurance, and nutrition (protein and carbohydrate intake). Complete daily quests, and failure to do so results in a penalty quest with additional challenges to keep you motivated.
## Features
- **Personalized Fitness Stats**: Track your strength, stamina, and endurance over time.
- **Workout Quests**: Complete daily workout tasks to level up.
- **Penalty Quests**: If you miss a workout, penalty quests with additional challenges will be assigned.
- **Nutrition Dashboard**: Track your daily intake of proteins and carbs to ensure a balanced diet.
- **RPG Elements**: Progress your stats like in an RPG, leveling up as you complete quests and stay consistent.
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **No Backend**: This app works entirely on the frontend, ideal for basic tracking and simple gamification.
## Usage
- Complete the daily quests such as push-ups, jogging, and plank.
- Once a quest is completed, your stats (strength, stamina, and endurance) will increase.
- If any quest is missed, a penalty quest will activate with additional challenges.
- Track your protein and carbohydrate intake to monitor your diet.
